Ticktickticket was my quick solution to a problem we encountered in my web dev bootcamp. While waiting for the instructor's help, it was often unclear who was next, who had been waiting the longest, etc. Ticktickticket is a reactive list that auto-refreshes in real-time so that it can be updated immediately from any browser in the classroom. Students enter their names with a short description of their question so the instructor always knows who to help next and what they need help with. 

And, just for fun, there's a button to thank the instructor that tracks how many times he's been thanked.
