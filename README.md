Demand was high in my dev bootcampe for one-on-one help with the instructor, and it wasn't always clear who was next in line or who had been waiting the longest. To solve this problem I created this reactive waitlist in Meteor that auto-refreshes in real-time and can be updated immediately by any student from any browser in the classroom. Students enter their names with a short description of their question, and the instructor always knows who to help next and why.

Over the course of the bootcamp, I updated this tool based on user feedback. Enhancements included a logging system to permanently track student issues. 

Completing this project gave me valuable experience using Meteor sessions, templates, and MongoDB collections.
