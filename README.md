In my web dev class a queue would often form for the instructor's help, and it wasn't always clear who was next or who had been waiting the longest. To solve this problem I created this reactive list in Meteor that auto-refreshes in real-time and can be updated immediately by any student from any browser in the classroom. Students enter their names with a short description of their question, and the instructor always knows who to help next and why. 

And, just for fun, there's a button to thank the instructor that tracks how many times he's been thanked. 

Completing this project gave me valuable experience using Meteor sessions, templates, and MongoDB collections.
